      <h2>NOBITA</h2>

      <p>Nobita is always scolled by his teacher for not doing homework, and jiaan and suniyo make his fun. Only her friend shizuka, help him a lot. Nobita likes shizuka and in the future he will marry her.
Doraemon has come to help Nobita to make his future bright. Doraemon has the pocket on his stomach, form where he removes the gadgets.  He always save Nobita from his friends.
But as usual Nobita get Zero marks in his test, and he hides the test papers, but unfortunately, the test papers are seen by his mother, and he again comes in trouble.    </div>

      <h2>SHIZUKA</h2>

      <p>Shizuka is a smart and kind neighbourhood girl. She is, unlike Nobita, a quick-witted and very studious child. Shizuka loves to bathe and does it several times a day passionately. Unlike Nobita, Suneo, and Gian, she is not a fan of video games.
She cares for weaker people, abused animals, and neglected dolls. She wishes to be a nurse or an air-hostess when she grows up. Both jobs reflect her kind nature. Shizuka loves her dolls a lot, to the extent that she loves them more than her own friends.</p>

      <h2>GIAN</h2>

      <p>Gian is recognized by his large build (might partly be contributed by obesity), as well as his mean and aggressive behavior. He "rules" the neighborhood with force, often to the physical expense of other children, especially Nobita, who often resorts to asking Doraemon for gadgets to get even on him. He appears to be just as depending on Nobita as Nobita is to Doraemon as he constantly tells him what to do despite Nobita's protest. In addition, he has a tendency and desire to steal things from other children, usually Suneo, who offers himself to be Gian's sidekick on most occasions.

Despite his flaws and big bully appearance, Gian is actually a good person inside and always helps his friends and is loyal to them when they are in trouble. The official US Doraemon website states that deep inside, Gian is just a simple guy with a big heart.    </div>

      <h2>SUNEO</h2>

      <p>He is a spoiled rich kid who likes to show off his cool stuff to his friends and make them jealous. The friends he hangs out with mostly are Nobita, Doraemon, Gian and Shizuka. He sometimes brags to his friends to things like meeting up with famous stars.

He gets around ¥5000 (US$40, £25.65) in monthly pocket money and buys cool toys and comic books, but he never lets Nobita touch his comics and cool toys, which provokes his anger and jealousy. He usually hangs out with Gian to think he is the coolest kid in the world like Gian and often bullies, irritates and/or beats up Nobita with Gian. Sometimes, he lies to Gian in order to please him and avoid falling victim to his beatings. He is also a member of the Giants baseball team. He is not very good in baseball, but he occasionally scores home runs.

      <h2>DORAMI</h2>

      <p>She is yellow and has a large red bow instead of ears. She happens to be about 2 years younger than Doraemon. Strangely enough, they are siblings due to the fact that they drank from the same oil can. She lives in 22nd-century Tokyo with Sewashi. She sometimes visits Nobita with a time machine when Doraemon is "off-duty" or to help Doraemon with something.

She likes Melon Bread and is afraid of cockroaches, according to the 1989 short film Mini-Dora SOS!!, although she shows no apparent fear of cockroaches in the last panel of the manga story Urashima Candy. She is also shown to be a more advanced robot than Doraemon    </div>
